Route Planner

This site takes advantage of the Google Maps Api. Allows the user to search for a particular
place and place markers on the map. Markers (waypoints) are being added to the list and then
their order can be changed by dragging them over each other. It is also possible to save the
plan in the browser localStorage and retrieve it later on.

The second part of the site contains a currency converter, which is based on the CurrencyLayer API.
The data is being got by using the JSONP method.
